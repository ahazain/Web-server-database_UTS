            <div>
                Instant noodles were first introduced and marketed in 1958 in <br>Japan. Due to its practicality and delicious <br>taste, instant noodles were well received and liked by the <br>Japanese. Soon after, its popularity spread throughout <br>the world including Indonesia. <br><br>
    Indomie instant noodles brand was first launched in 1972 <br>with Indomie Chicken flavour. In 1982, Indomie launched <br>Mi Goreng, the first dry noodles variant (consumed <br>without broth), inspired by the traditional Indonesian <br>fried noodles dish. Indomie Mi Goreng quickly became <br>very popular and broke through the instant noodles <br>market. Indomie has since become a household brand <br>name in Indonesia and holds the majority of market share <br>in Indonesia. <br><br>
    Hard work, perseverance, and innovation were the key <br>factors that made Indomie flourished to be the most <br>chosen instant noodles in Indonesia (Kantar Worldpanel,<br> 2018). After more than four decades, Indomie still holds <br>those values dearly and maintain its reputable standing.
